            This is quite possibly the one thing that I am constantly asked to make. This is a ziti with a lot of
            flavor.

            </li>
            <li>
                ½ teaspoon salt
            </li>
            <li>
                ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
            </li>
            <li>
                1 ½ (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce, divided
            </li>
            <li>
                1 (8 ounce) package shredded Italian cheese blend
            </li>
            <li>
                1 teaspoon dried basil (Optional)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is
                boiling, stir in the ziti, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until
                the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander
                set in the sink.
            </li>
            <li>
                While pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage, and cook and stir until
                brown, about 10 minutes. Drain sausage and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir together the ricotta, egg, onion, garlic, and oregano in a large bowl until well combined. Stir in
                the drained pasta, the drained sausage, salt, pepper, and 1/2 jar of the spaghetti sauce; mix well.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the prepared baking dish, cover the bottom with 1/3 jar of spaghetti sauce. Layer 1/2 of the pasta
                mixture, 1/3 jar of spaghetti sauce, and 1/2 of the shredded cheese. Then layer the remaining 1/2 of the
                pasta, 1/3 of the sauce, and 1/2 of the cheese. Sprinkle with basil. Cover the dish tightly with
                aluminum foil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes. Uncover; return to the oven and bake
                until cheese is melted, 5 to 10 more minutes.
            </li>
